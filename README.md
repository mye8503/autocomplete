# autocomplete

This program was created for a project in one of my first-year coding courses. It takes in an incomplete city name and returns up to 5 matching city names, in weighted order. The weights and cities included can be viewed in the cities.txt file.

## How to use me
In the terminal, navigate to the folder containing main.c and type
```
./runme <cityname>
```
